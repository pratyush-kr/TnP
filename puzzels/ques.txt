Given two integers m & n, find the number of possible sequences of length n
such that each of the next element is greater than or equal to twice of the
previous element but less than or equal to m.

Input: m = 10, n = 4
Output: 4
Explaination: There should be n elements and 
value of last element should be at-most m. 
The sequences are {1, 2, 4, 8}, {1, 2, 4, 9}, 
{1, 2, 4, 10}, {1, 2, 5, 10}.

Expected Time Complexity: O(m*n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ m, n ≤ 100
